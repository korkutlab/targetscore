\title{Predict Network from signedPC (curated knowledge bio-inferred network)}
\usage{
predict_bio_network(
  n_prot,
  proteomic_responses,
  max_dist,
  mab_to_genes,
  dist_file = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_prot}{Antibody number of input data.}

\item{proteomic_responses}{Input drug perturbation data. With columns as antibody, rows as samples.}

\item{max_dist}{maximum distance between two antibody. (Default at 1)}

\item{mab_to_genes}{A list of antibodies, their associated genes, modification sites and effect.}

\item{dist_file}{A distance file an edgelist with a third column which is the network distance
between the genes in the interaction}

\item{verbose}{whether to show debugging information}
}
\value{
a list is returned with the following entries:
* "wk" inferred network matrix form with edge strength value default at 1 for
upregulate and -1 for down regulate.
* "wks" as inferred network matrix form with edge strength value default at 1 for
upregulate and -1 for down regulate and 2 for phosphorylation and -2 for dephosphorylation.
* "dist_ind" A distance file of edgelist with a third column as the network distance
between the genes in the interaction.
* "inter" file as edgelist of inferred network
* "edgelist" file as sif file of edgelist for inferred network.
