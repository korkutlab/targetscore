# Purpose 

This tutorial describes the basic introduction and usage of TargetScore.

# Introduction

In cancer treatment, targeted therapies have been substantially successful in treatment of diverse cancer types. However, resistance to therapy is virtually inevitable and can manifest as a lack of initial response to therapy (intrinsic) or disease progression after temporary response.we have hypothesized that robust activation of functionally connected oncogene groups in response to therapy are better predictors of adaptive drug resistance. And the collective adaptive responses can be targeted with drug combinations to overcome the resistance and induce more durable therapeutic responses. Accordingly, we have developed a statistical network modeling method Target Score.

# Setup 
## Load Packages 

```{r}
# Target Score package
library(targetscore)

# Plot packages
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(pheatmap)

# Data Manipulation packages
library(plyr)
library(data.table)
library(matrixStats)
```

## Load Data 
Mandatory loading data including: Drug perturbation data (proteomic_responses). User may also provided antibody file and defined function score for certain antibody. 

Several parameters should be settled:
1.max_dist: Max distance between protein network was default at 1 which limits the maximum protein-protein distance.
2.n_prot: Number of Antibodies included in the User provided drug perturbation data.

Other files that can be attached are:
1. mab_to_genes: list of antibodies, their associated genes, modification sites and effect.
2. fs_override: a listing of functional scores for each gene manually set up for overriding COSMIC Database given value, the modification path.

```{r parameters}
# data_dir <- "../data(ts)/ts_anil"

data_dir <- system.file("test_data", package = "targetscore")
resource_dir <- system.file("target_score_data", package = "targetscore")
output_dir <- "inst/test_data/tutorial_output"

# Check if package installed or just downloaded from code repo
data_dir <- ifelse(dir.exists(data_dir), data_dir, "inst/test_data")
resource_dir <- ifelse(dir.exists(resource_dir), resource_dir, "inst/target_score_data")
output_dir <- ifelse(dir.exists(output_dir), output_dir, ".")

# Number of antibodies
n_prot <- 100

# Max distance
max_dist <- 1 # changing this value requires additional work to compute product(wk). This is not a priority
# verbose <- FALSE
```

### Read Antibody File 
The Antibody file is the Gene Name list database which provided the onsite AnitobodyLabel of local upload files with the Gene_Symbol used within the database/package. While Antibody file also provided the information of phosphorylation activation/deactivation.

#### Columns
* AntibodyLabel: Antibody label from local data. The AnitibodyLabel will serve as the label alongside all calculation.
* Source: Source of the Antibody. The provided antibody_map_file contains two sources including MDACC as MD Anderson Cancer Center and MSKCC standing for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
* NodeName: MDACC standardized Antibody Name.
* Gene_Symbol: Corresponding HGNC symbol and Ensembl ID
* Sites: Phosphorylation site. NA stands for no phosphorylation. One site phosphorylation, for example:S473 for Akt_pS473, Two site phosphorylation, for example :Y1234|Y1235 for c.Met_pY1234_Y1235.
* Effect: The effect of Phosphorylation. Including:
  * c : no phosphorylation
  * a : activation
  * i : inhibition

#### Rows
* Each row is a specific antibody.

```{r load_data}
mab_to_genes <- read.csv(file.path(resource_dir, "antibody_map_08092019.csv"), 
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

### Read Drug Perturbation Data
Perturbation Response Data is the drug perturbation data provided by the user. We have provided an example drug perturbation response file here which provided by Anil Korkut lab.

### Rows
* Each row is a drug perturbation treatment

### Columns
* Each column is a specific Antibody.

```{r}
# Read drug perturbation data for BT474
proteomic_responses <- read.csv(file.path(data_dir, "BT474.csv"), row.names = 1) # n_prot=100
```

### Read Functional Scores
Functional scores is a functional role assigned as a numeric score to proteomic entities.there is evidence for an entity’s function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in cancer. A central basis for this cancer role comes the curated and widely-used COSMIC database.
* Different functional score value are assigned: oncogene as +1, tumor suppressor as -1, or 0 both or unknown
* It is also possible for users to manually alter these scores referring from literature or through expert editing, if necessary.

### Columns
* gene : HGNC symbol and Ensembl ID
* fs : Corresponding functional score

### Rows
* Each row is a specific Antibody.

```{r}
fs_override <- read.csv(file.path(data_dir, "fs.csv"), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Extract Network 
Three ways of constructing reference networks are provided in the algorithm including knowledge-base reference network from SignedPC; data-driven reference network based on graphical lasso and hybrid-approach reference network termed pr-glasso.

## Knowledge-base reference network

Inferred from Pathway Commons and BioPax based database. knowledge base reference network integrates detailed human pathway data from multiple public resources such as Reactome, NCI PID, PhosphoSitePlus and Panther pathway database. Of interest to us, only four relationship was extracted out as: phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, expression upregulation, and expression downregulation.

```{r extract_network}
# Extract network
network <- targetscore::predict_bio_network(
  n_prot = n_prot,
  proteomic_responses = proteomic_responses,
  max_dist = max_dist,
  mab_to_genes = mab_to_genes
)

saveRDS(network, file.path(output_dir, "bt474_bionetwork.rds"))
```

## Data-driven reference network

Data driven reference network captures the molecular associations and inter-tumor heterogeneity across a population of samples with shared characteristics (e.g., breast cancer or basal-like subtype patients). The approach benefits from omics data that captures the signaling variations.

To be explained, the data-driven signaling network captures the protein-protein interaction by estimating the sparse undirected partial correlation. It based on graphical lasso models through the use of L1 (lasso) regularization.

     argmax(Θ)=(log( detΘ -tr(SΘ)-rho*||Θ||)

```{r extract_data-driven_network}
# Read Global Signaling file for BRCA
signaling_responses <- read.csv(system.file("test_data", "TCGA-BRCA-L4.csv", package = "targetscore"), row.names = 1)

# Extract network
network <- targetscore::predict_dat_network(
  data <- signaling_responses,
  n_prot = n_prot,
  proteomic_responses = proteomic_responses
)

saveRDS(network, file.path(output_dir, "bt474_datnetwork.rds"))
```

## Hybrid-approach (pr-glasso) reference network

We have developed a modified version of the glasso algorithm, termed pr (prior) -glasso. pr-glasso integrates experimental constraints with prior information from knowledge signaling databases

The prior information is incorporated into the inference with a probabilistic term that favors prior interactions that conform to the experimental data, eliminates priors that do not conform and predict novel interactions dictated solely by the experimental data. The prior information narrows the potential solutions to a biologically more relevant domain of the search space.

	argmax(Θ)=( log detΘ -tr(SΘ)-(rho*I+kappa*λ||Θ||)

Which ro be explained, is to give smaller penalty parameter to the interaction that already existed in the knowledge base reference network.


```{r extract_biology_network}

# Extract protein-protein interaction knowledge
network <- targetscore::predict_bio_network(
  n_prot = n_prot,
  proteomic_responses = proteomic_responses,
  max_dist = max_dist,
  mab_to_genes = mab_to_genes
)

prior <- network$wk

# pr-glasso
network <- targetscore::predict_hybrid_network(
  data = signaling_responses,
  prior = prior,
  n_prot = n_prot,
  proteomic_responses = proteomic_responses,
  mab_to_genes = mab_to_genes
)

saveRDS(network, file.path(output_dir, "bt474_hybnetwork.rds"))
```

# Extract functional score 

A function score was given inferred from COSMIC database indicating whether the protein is an onco-protein or tumor suppressor overrided by the user provided functional score.

```{r extract_fs}
# Extract functional score
fs <- targetscore::get_fs_vals(
  n_prot = n_prot,
  proteomic_responses = proteomic_responses,
  mab_to_genes = mab_to_genes,
  fs_override = fs_override
)

saveRDS(fs, file.path(output_dir, "bt474_fs.rds"))
```

# Run Target Score 

The Target Score is calculated for each measured entity (e.g, protein) under each condition. It is quantified as the network interaction weighted sum of the "self-change" of the corresponding entity and the change in the pathway/network neighborhood in response to targeted perturbations. The statistical assessment of Target Score is then reached at Random sampling of proteomic responses (randomized Ab label mixing) at each drug dose generates the randomized data sets over all antibody readouts.

**NOTE:** n_perm is set to 25 for demonstration purposes. 

# Guidance for Selecting Number of Perturbations (n_perm)

Choose a number greater than the total number of nodes; 1000 is often reasonable. Different large values (e.g., 1000, 2000, etc.) can be examined to ensure that p-values have converged and are stable. 

```{r target_score_calculation_example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
